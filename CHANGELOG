23. April 2016: Mecrisp-Ice 0.7

* New binary image for HX8K !

  + Double amount of memory: 16 kb instead of 8 kb
  + Double stack depth: 32 elements each instead of 16
  + Barrel shifter for single cycle lshift rshift arshift
  + Single cycle multiplication
  + Fast opcodes for 1+ and 1-
  + rdepth
  + 8 LEDs instead of 5
  + Lots of gates free for experiments
  - 36 MHz only
  - No IrDA

* Larger address range made a different dictionary header structure necessary
  to still accomodate flags for foldability and immediate.

  * Initialised variables
  * LF only instead of CR+LF
