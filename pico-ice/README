This is a basic mecrisp-ice for the pico-ice.
in the
mecrisp root directory first retype the first few lines of the
./compile file.   That will compile the pascal emulator for your platform.

Then in the mecrisp***/pico-ice directory
./compile

To flash the gateware try:
dfu-util -a 0 -D j1a.bin

or for older installations
dfu-util -a 1 -D j1a.bin

To talk to the fpga, first you have to find the usb devices.  On Mac
OS X I did

ls /dev | grep usb

To get proper cr behavior try:
picocom --imap crcrlf,lfcrlf /dev/tty.usbmodem1103
